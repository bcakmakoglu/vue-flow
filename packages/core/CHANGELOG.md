## 1.10.0

### Minor Changes

- [#579](https://github.com/bcakmakoglu/vue-flow/pull/579) [`b8d3241`](https://github.com/bcakmakoglu/vue-flow/commit/b8d324184fdb974b96d1b54aa042835b7ce83482) Thanks [@bcakmakoglu](https://github.com/bcakmakoglu)! - Allow setting `padding` option for `node.extent: 'parent'`

  Padding can be a `number[]` containing a maximum of 4 values.
  The values are applied in the same order as CSS padding: top, right, bottom, left.
  You can omit values at the end of the array, so `[10, 20]` is equivalent to `[10, 20, 10, 20]` etc.

  #### Usage

  ```js
  const nodes = ref([
    {
      id: "4",
      label: "Node 4",
      position: { x: 320, y: 200 },
      style: {
        backgroundColor: "rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.7)",
        width: "300px",
        height: "300px",
      },
    },
    {
      id: "4a",
      label: "Node 4a",
      position: { x: 15, y: 65 },
      class: "light",
      extent: {
        range: "parent",
        // apply 10 px padding to all four sides
        padding: [10],
      },
      parentNode: "4",
    },
  ]);
  ```

## 1.9.0

### Minor Changes

- [#557](https://github.com/bcakmakoglu/vue-flow/pull/557) [`c7897a1`](https://github.com/bcakmakoglu/vue-flow/commit/c7897a1da80a0e22c6e286706de8193db293f433) Thanks [@bcakmakoglu](https://github.com/bcakmakoglu)! - Allow customizing the controls of the viewport and the selection box.

  #### Props

  - `selectionKeyCode`: You can now set this to `MaybeRef<boolean>` to enable a selection box without extra button press (need to set `:pan-on-drag="false"` or `:pan-on-drag="[2]"`[RightClick]).
  - `panOnDrag`: Can now be a boolean or a number[], this allows you to configure every mouse button as a drag button. [1, 2] would mean that you can drag via middle and right mouse button.
  - `panActivationKeyCode`: Key code (or KeyFilter) for activating dragging (useful when using selectionOnDrag).
  - `selectionMode`: You can choose if the selection box needs to contain a node fully (`SelectionMode.Full`) or partially (`SelectionMode.Partial`) to select.

  #### Events

  - `onSelectionStart`: Emitted when the selection box is started.
  - `onSelectionEnd`: Emitted when the selection box is ended.
  - `onViewportChangeStart`: Emitted when viewport change has started.
  - `onViewportChange`: Emitted when viewport is changed.
  - `onViewportChangeEnd`: Emitted when viewport change has ended.

### Patch Changes

- [#558](https://github.com/bcakmakoglu/vue-flow/pull/558) [`bac9893`](https://github.com/bcakmakoglu/vue-flow/commit/bac98930da15fe049ab8f1ac65f09dd67e0000fb) Thanks [@bcakmakoglu](https://github.com/bcakmakoglu)! - ⚠️ Deprecate options API utils `addEdge` and `updateEdge`. These utils will be removed soon!

  #### Resolve deprecation warnings

  Instead of using these utils, use `addEdges` and `updateEdge` found on the VueFlow store instance.
  You receive a store instance by using either a template-ref or listening to the `onPaneReady` event.

  ### Example

  ```vue
  <script>
  import { VueFlow } from "@vue-flow/core";

  export default defineComponent({
    name: "OptionsAPIExample",

          { id: "e1-3", source: "1", target: "3" },
        ],
      };

### A11y

This release brings A11y support to Vue Flow. All nodes and edges can now receive a `focusable` and `ariaLabel` prop, which can be used to enhance A11y experience. You can also enable focusable globally by using `nodesFocusable` or `edgesFocusable`.
Additionally, nodes can be moved using keyboard controls (Arrow-Keys).

#### Props

- `disableKeyboardA11y`: Use this prop to disable Keyboard controls on the graph.
- `defaultViewport`: The old `defaultZoom` and `defaultPosition` props have been merged into a single object called `defaultViewport`.
- `nodesFocusable`: Globally enable that nodes can be focused.
- `edgesFocusable`: Globally enable that edges can be focused.

#### Elements

- `focusable`: Enable focusing for a single node/edge by setting this option.
- `ariaLabel`: Specify an aria label for a node/edge

  ### Usage

  - You can either use the action `getIntersectingNodes` to find all nodes that intersect with a given node

  ```js
  const { onNodeDrag, getIntersectingNodes, getNodes } = useVueFlow();

  onNodeDrag(({ node }) => {
    const intersections = getIntersectingNodes(node).map((n) => n.id);

    getNodes.value.forEach((n) => {
      // highlight nodes that are intersecting with the dragged node
      n.class = intersections.includes(n.id) ? "highlight" : "";
    });
  });
  ```

  - Node drag events will provide you with the intersecting nodes without having to call the action explicitly.

  ```js
  onNodeDrag(({ intersections }) => {
    getNodes.value.forEach((n) => {
      n.class = intersections?.some((i) => i.id === n.id) ? "highlight" : "";
    });
  });
  ```

  - Or you can use the `isIntersecting` util to check if a node intersects with a given area

  ```js
  const { onNodeDrag, isNodeIntersecting } = useVueFlow();

  onNodeDrag(({ node }) => {
    // highlight the node if it is intersecting with the given area
    node.class = isNodeIntersecting(node, {
      x: 0,
      y: 0,
      width: 100,
      height: 100,
    })
      ? "highlight"
      : "";
  });
  ```

- [#396](https://github.com/bcakmakoglu/vue-flow/pull/396) [`03412ac`](https://github.com/bcakmakoglu/vue-flow/commit/03412acf0d4452c104cc342e5e11eb3a7671fe72) Thanks [@bcakmakoglu](https://github.com/bcakmakoglu)! - Add zoomable and pannable to MiniMap

  ### Usage

  - Set `zoomable` and `pannable` to `true` in `MiniMap` component to enable interactions with the MiniMap

  ```vue
  <template>
    <VueFlow v-model="elements">
      <MiniMap :zoomable="true" :pannable="true" />
    </VueFlow>
  </template>
  ```

### Patch Changes

- [#361](https://github.com/bcakmakoglu/vue-flow/pull/361) [`43ff2a4`](https://github.com/bcakmakoglu/vue-flow/commit/43ff2a42e6d77251b3fe7987afa02c19cdb2f240) Thanks [@bcakmakoglu](https://github.com/bcakmakoglu)! - Add `EdgeLabelRenderer` component export

  ### Usage

  - You can use the `EdgeLabelRenderer` component to render the label of an edge outside the SVG context of edges.
  - The `EdgeLabelRenderer` component is a component that handles teleporting your edge label into a HTML context
  - This is useful if you want to use HTML elements in your edge label, like buttons

  ```vue
  <script lang="ts" setup>
  import type { EdgeProps, Position } from "@vue-flow/core";
  import { EdgeLabelRenderer, getBezierPath, useVueFlow } from "@vue-flow/core";
  import type { CSSProperties } from "vue";

  interface CustomEdgeProps<T = any> extends EdgeProps<T> {
    id: string;
    sourceX: number;
    sourceY: number;
    targetX: number;
    targetY: number;
    sourcePosition: Position;
    targetPosition: Position;
    data: T;
    markerEnd: string;
    style: CSSProperties;
  }

  const props = defineProps<CustomEdgeProps>();

  const { removeEdges } = useVueFlow();

  const path = $computed(() => getBezierPath(props));
  </script>

  <script lang="ts">
  export default {
    inheritAttrs: false,
  };
  </script>

  <template>
    <path
      :id="id"
      :style="style"
      class="vue-flow__edge-path"
      :d="path[0]"
      :marker-end="markerEnd"
    />

    <EdgeLabelRenderer>
      <div
        :style="{
          pointerEvents: 'all',
          position: 'absolute',
          transform: `translate(-50%, -50%) translate(${path[1]}px,${path[2]}px)`,
        }"
        class="nodrag nopan"
      >
        <button class="edgebutton" @click="removeEdges([id])">×</button>
      </div>
    </EdgeLabelRenderer>
  </template>

  <style>
  .edgebutton {
    border-radius: 999px;
    cursor: pointer;
  }
  .edgebutton:hover {
    box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px pink, 0 0 0 4px #f05f75;
  }
  </style>
  ```

### Minor Changes

- [#311](https://github.com/bcakmakoglu/vue-flow/pull/311) [`78f9ee1c`](https://github.com/bcakmakoglu/vue-flow/commit/78f9ee1cb77cc00590b8d4529da7cd124ddfc0f6) Thanks [@bcakmakoglu](https://github.com/bcakmakoglu)! - # What's changed?

  - Add `HandleConnectable` type
  - Update `connectable` prop of `Handle` to `HandleConnectable` type
  - Allow to specify if Handles are connectable
    - any number of connections
    - none
    - single connection
    - or a cb to determine whether the Handle is connectable

  Example:

  ```vue
  <script lang="ts" setup>
  import { Handle, HandleConnectable } from "@vue-flow/core";

  const handleConnectable: HandleConnectable = (node, connectedEdges) => {
    console.log(node, connectedEdges);
    return true;
  };
  </script>
  <template>
    <!-- single connection -->
    <Handle type="target" position="left" connectable="single" />
    <div>Custom Node</div>
    <!-- cb -->
    <Handle id="a" position="right" :connectable="handleConnectable" />
  </template>
  ```

  - Update `node.connectable` prop to `HandleConnectable`

  For Example:

  ```js
  const nodes = ref([
    {
      id: "1",
      position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
      connectable: "single", // each handle is only connectable once (default node for example)
    },
    {
      id: "2",
      position: { x: 200, y: 0 },
      connectable: (node, connectedEdges) => {
        return true; // will allow any number of connections
      },
    },
    {
      id: "3",
      position: { x: 400, y: 0 },
      connectable: true, // will allow any number of connections
    },
    {
      id: "4",
      position: { x: 200, y: 0 },
      connectable: false, // will disable handles
    },
  ]);
  ```

  - Simplify `useHandle` usage
  - Pass props to the composable as possible refs
    - Still returns onClick & onMouseDown handlers but only expects mouse event now

  Before:

  ```vue
  <script lang="ts" setup>
  import { useHandle, NodeId } from "@vue-flow/core";

  const nodeId = inject(NodeId);

  const handleId = "my-handle";

  const type = "source";

  const isValidConnection = () => true;

  const { onMouseDown } = useHandle();

  const onMouseDownHandler = (event: MouseEvent) => {
    onMouseDown(
      event,
      handleId,
      nodeId,
      type === "target",
      isValidConnection,
      undefined
    );
  };
  </script>

  <template>
    <div @mousedown="onMouseDownHandler" />
  </template>
  ```

  After:

  ```vue
  <script lang="ts" setup>
  import { useHandle, useNode } from "@vue-flow/core";

  const { nodeId } = useNode();

  const handleId = "my-handle";

  const type = "source";

  const isValidConnection = () => true;

  const { onMouseDown } = useHandle({
    nodeId,
    handleId,
    isValidConnection,
    type,
  });
  </script>

  - Edges not returned by getter when `paneReady` event is triggered

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#305](https://github.com/bcakmakoglu/vue-flow/pull/305) [`939bff50`](https://github.com/bcakmakoglu/vue-flow/commit/939bff503039af3b790160640548ddde984cf2bc) Thanks [@bcakmakoglu](https://github.com/bcakmakoglu)! - # What's changed?

  - Simplify edge path calculations
    - remove `getEdgeCenter` and `getSimpleEdgeCenter`

  # Breaking Changes

  - `getEdgeCenter` has been removed
    - Edge center positions can now be accessed from `getBezierPath` or `getSmoothStepPath` functions

  Before:

  ```js
  import { getBezierPath, getEdgeCenter } from "@braks/vue-flow";

  // used to return the path string only
  const edgePath = computed(() => getBezierPath(pathParams));

  // was necessary to get the centerX, centerY of an edge
  const centered = computed(() => getEdgeCenter(centerParams));
  ```

  After:

  ```js
  import { getBezierPath } from "@vue-flow/core";

  // returns the path string and the center positions
  const [path, centerX, centerY] = computed(() => getBezierPath(pathParams));
  ```

  - Change pkg scope from 'braks' to 'vue-flow'
    - Add `@vue-flow/core` package
    - Add `@vue-flow/additional-components` package
    - Add `@vue-flow/pathfinding-edge` package
    - Add `@vue-flow/resize-rotate-node` package

  # Features

  - `useNode` and `useEdge` composables
    - can be used to access current node/edge (or by id) and their respective element refs (if used inside the elements' context, i.e. a custom node/edge)
  - `selectionKeyCode` as `true`
    - allows for figma style selection (i.e. create a selection rect without holding shift or any other key)
  - Handles to trigger handle bounds calculation on mount
    - if no handle bounds are found, a Handle will try to calculate its bounds on mount
    - should remove the need for `updateNodeInternals` on dynamic handles
  - Testing for various features using Cypress 10

  # Bugfixes

  - Fix `removeSelectedEdges` and `removeSelectedNodes` actions not properly removing elements from store

  # Breaking Changes

  - `@vue-flow/core` package is now required to use vue-flow
  - `@vue-flow/additional-components` package contains `Background`, `MiniMap` and `Controls` components and related types
    - When switching to the new pkg scope, you need to change the import path.

  Before:

  ```js
  import { VueFlow, Background, MiniMap, Controls } from "@braks/vue-flow";
  ```

  After

  ```js
  import { VueFlow } from "@vue-flow/core";
  import {
    Background,
    MiniMap,
    Controls,
  } from "@vue-flow/additional-components";
  ```
