# Custom Connection Line

If the default connection lines aren't to your liking, or you want to expand on the existing 
functionality you can use your own custom connection line.

Simply pass a component in the designated template slot, and you're good to go.

<div class="mt-6">
  <Suspense>
    <Repl example="connectionline"></Repl>
  </Suspense>
</div>
