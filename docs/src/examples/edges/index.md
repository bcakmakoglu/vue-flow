# Edges

Vue Flow comes with four pre-defined edge types - bezier-, step-, smoothstep and straight-edges.
In addition to the built-in edge types you can create your own custom edges. You can find more information on edge types [here](/guide/edge.html#default-edge-types).

<div class="mt-6">
  <ClientOnly>
    <Suspense>
      <Repl example="edges"></Repl>
    </Suspense>
  </ClientOnly>
</div>
