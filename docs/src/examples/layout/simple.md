# Layout

A lot of the time, you'll want to layout your nodes automatically instead of assigning their positions manually.
Vue Flow does *not* have a built-in layouting system, but it's easy to use a third-party library to achieve this.

In this example we are going to use [dagre](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre) to layout our nodes.

<div class="mt-6">
  <Repl example="layoutSimple"></Repl>
</div>
