## 🛠 Setup

```bash
$ npm i @vue-flow/core

# or
$ pnpm i @vue-flow/core

# or
$ yarn add @vue-flow/core
```

## 🎮 Quickstart

In Vue Flow, an application structure consists of __nodes__ and __edges__, all of which are categorised as __elements__.

__Each element requires a unique id.__

Nodes additionally need an __XY-position__, while edges require a __source__ and a __target__, both represented by node ids.

```vue
<!-- Flowchart.vue -->
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'  
import { VueFlow } from '@vue-flow/core'

const nodes = ref([
  { id: '1', type: 'input', label: 'Node 1', position: { x: 250, y: 5 } },
  { id: '2', label: 'Node 2', position: { x: 100, y: 100 } },
  { id: '3', label: 'Node 3', position: { x: 400, y: 100 } },
  { id: '4', label: 'Node 4', position: { x: 400, y: 200 } },
])
  
const edges = ref([
  { id: 'e1-2', source: '1', target: '2', animated: true },
  { id: 'e1-3', source: '1', target: '3' },
])
</script>

<template>
  <VueFlow v-model:nodes="nodes" v-model:edges="edges"></VueFlow>
</template>
```

⚠️ __Make sure to import the necessary styles:__

```css
/* the default theme (structure + the built-in look) */
@import "@vue-flow/core/dist/style.css";

/* or, to bring your own theme, import the minimal structure only */
/* @import "@vue-flow/core/dist/base.css"; */
```

Do __not__ scope these styles with `scoped` in your component.

### 🪴 Vue 2

**_This library doesn't work with Vue 2._**

Vue Flow uses features that are exclusive to Vue 3, therefore
there is no support for Vue 2, nor will there be any support in the future, sorry.

## 🧪 Development

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js v20+](https://nodejs.org/)
- [pnpm v9+](https://pnpm.io/)

```bash
# install pnpm if you haven't already
$ npm i -g pnpm

# start examples
$ pnpm dev

# build all packages
$ pnpm build
```

### 🐳 Dev Container

To start using development containers, install the `Docker` extension
for VSCode.
After installing the extension, open the connection menu either
on the bottom left or open it via the commands tab.
Select the `Open Folder in Container` option to mount the project.

The development container will spin up all packages example apps and forward
the ports to your machine.
